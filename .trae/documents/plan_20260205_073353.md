I found the issue. The **Login page is still hardcoded** to `http://localhost:3001/api/login`, which will fail on the VPS (because your browser can't reach the VPS's localhost).

### **Plan**

1. **Fix Frontend (`client/src/pages/Login.jsx`)**:

   * Change `http://localhost:3001/api/login` to just `/api/login`.

   * This allows the Nginx proxy we set up to handle the routing correctly.

2. **Enhance CLI Tool (`server/create-user.js`)**:

   * Update the script to allow **resetting passwords** for existing users (in case you forgot `admin` or want to force a change).

   * Usage: `node create-user.js admin newpassword` will update it if it exists, or create it if not.

3. **Deployment**:

   * You will need to rebuild the frontend (`npm run build`) and re-upload the `dist` folder to your VPS.
