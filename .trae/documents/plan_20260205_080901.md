The AI isn't replying likely because `OPENAI_API_KEY` isn't loading correctly or the bot logic in `sessionManager.js` isn't triggering.

### **Plan**

1.  **Add Debug Logging (`sessionManager.js`)**:
    -   Log when a message is received.
    -   Log the value of `botEnabled`.
    -   Log if it decides to generate a response.

2.  **Add Debug Logging (`ai.js`)**:
    -   Log when `generateResponse` starts.
    -   Log if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is missing.
    -   Log any errors from OpenAI.

3.  **Check API Key**:
    -   Verify that `OPENAI_API_KEY` is actually present in `process.env` when the server starts.

### **Why?**
The user sees "initializing" fixed and can add devices, but the core function (AI reply) is silent. Logs will tell us exactly where the chain breaks.
