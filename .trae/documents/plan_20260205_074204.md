I need to fix the issue where the QR code doesn't appear when adding a new device. This is likely because the Puppeteer instance on the VPS is missing necessary system dependencies (Chrome/Chromium libraries) to run in headless mode.

### **Plan**

1.  **Diagnose**: The `whatsapp-web.js` library uses Puppeteer (headless Chrome). On a fresh Linux VPS, standard libraries (like `libnss3`, `libatk`, `libcups`, etc.) are often missing.

2.  **Fix 1: Install Dependencies (System Level)**:
    -   I will provide a shell command to install the required libraries for Puppeteer.

3.  **Fix 2: Update Puppeteer Config (`server/src/services/sessionManager.js`)**:
    -   Add `--no-sandbox` and `--disable-setuid-sandbox` flags (already present, but good to verify).
    -   **Crucial**: Add `executablePath: '/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable'` (or chromium) if we install it manually, OR rely on the bundled one but ensure it can run.

4.  **Action**:
    -   I will update the `sessionManager.js` to be more robust with Puppeteer arguments.
    -   I will instruct the user to run the dependency installation command.

### **Why is this happening?**
The logs showed "initializing" but stuck there. This usually means Puppeteer crashed silently or is waiting for a library that doesn't exist.
