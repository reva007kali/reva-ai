I will create a comprehensive `DEPLOYMENT.md` guide for deploying this application to a Linux VPS (Ubuntu/Debian) without a domain name.

### **Plan**

1.  **Create `DEPLOYMENT.md`**:
    -   **Prerequisites**: VPS with Ubuntu 20.04/22.04, Node.js, PM2, Nginx.
    -   **Step 1: Environment Setup**: Installing Node.js, Git, and build tools.
    -   **Step 2: Project Upload**: Using `scp` or `git` to transfer files.
    -   **Step 3: Backend Setup**: Installing dependencies, `.env` configuration, and running with PM2.
    -   **Step 4: Frontend Setup**: Building the Vite app for production.
    -   **Step 5: Nginx Configuration (IP-based)**:
        -   Configuring Nginx to serve the static frontend files.
        -   Setting up a Reverse Proxy to route `/api` and `socket.io` requests to the backend (port 3001).
        -   Using the VPS IP address directly (e.g., `http://123.45.67.89`).
    -   **Step 6: Firewall**: Opening ports 80 (HTTP) and SSH.

### **Can you upload without a domain?**
**Yes.** You can access your application directly via your VPS IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.1`).
-   The frontend will be served on port 80 (default HTTP).
-   Nginx will proxy API calls internally, so you don't need to expose port 3001 publicly.
