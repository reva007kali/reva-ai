I will create a debugging script to verify the login credentials directly on the server. This will tell us if the issue is with the password/database or something else (like the API/Network).

### **Plan**

1.  **Update `server/src/config.js`**:
    -   Modify it to respect the `DB_PATH` from `.env` if it exists. This ensures consistency if you change the database location later.

2.  **Create `server/verify-login.js`**:
    -   This script will accept `username` and `password`.
    -   It will connect to the *exact same database* as the app.
    -   It will check if the user exists and run `bcrypt.compare()`.
    -   **Goal**: If this script says "Valid", but the web login says "Invalid", we know the issue is network/proxy related. If this script says "Invalid", then the password in the DB is definitely wrong.

3.  **Instruction**:
    -   Run `node verify-login.js myuser mypassword` to test.
