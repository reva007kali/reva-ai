I cannot display the exact **account balance** because OpenAI has deprecated the API endpoint for fetching credit balances.

However, I can implement an **Estimated Cost** feature that calculates the daily spending based on your token usage and the selected model.

### **Plan**
1.  **Update Dashboard (`client/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`)**:
    -   Fetch the active `openai_model` from settings.
    -   Implement a cost estimation logic:
        -   **GPT-3.5 Turbo**: ~$1.00 / 1M tokens
        -   **GPT-4o**: ~$5.00 / 1M tokens
        -   **GPT-4o Mini**: ~$0.40 / 1M tokens
    -   Display the **"Est. Cost: $0.0000"** inside the Token Usage card.

This provides the financial insight you need without requiring the deprecated API.
