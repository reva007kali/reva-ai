I will upgrade the system to support **Multiple WhatsApp Accounts** (Multi-Device/Multi-Session). This allows you to connect multiple phone numbers (e.g., "Support", "Sales", "Personal") to the same Reva AI dashboard.

### **Plan**

1.  **Database Updates (`server/src/db.js`)**:
    -   Create a `sessions` table to track connected bots (`session_id`, `description`, `created_at`).
    -   Add `local_jid` column to `chats` table to distinguish which bot received the message.

2.  **Backend Architecture (`server/src/services/sessionManager.js`)**:
    -   Replace the single-client `whatsapp.js` with a `SessionManager`.
    -   Manage a collection of `Client` instances: `Map<sessionId, Client>`.
    -   Handle events (QR, Ready, Message) for *each* session independently.
    -   Emit socket events with session context: `io.emit('session_update', { sessionId, status, qr })`.

3.  **API Endpoints (`server/src/routes.js`)**:
    -   `GET /api/sessions`: List all active/configured sessions.
    -   `POST /api/sessions`: Create a new session (starts a new WhatsApp client).
    -   `DELETE /api/sessions/:id`: Logout and delete a session.

4.  **Frontend Dashboard (`client/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`)**:
    -   Replace the single "Connection Status" card with a **"Connected Devices"** grid.
    -   Add a **"Connect New Device"** button.
    -   Display individual status (Online/QR/Disconnected) for each device.

### **Why this interpretation?**
"Connected to multi devices" usually means either using the **WhatsApp Multi-Device** feature (which allows your phone to be offline) OR connecting **multiple phone numbers**. Since the library supports the former by default, I am implementing the latter to give you maximum flexibility.
