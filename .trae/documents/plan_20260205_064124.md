I will help you add a new admin user to your running VPS application. Since SQLite stores the database locally in a file (usually `reva.db`), you don't need to "upload" a SQL file. The app creates the database automatically on the first run.

However, to add a *new* user manually (since there is no "Sign Up" page for security reasons), I will create a simple **CLI script** that you can run on your server.

### **Plan**

1.  **Create `create-user.js`**:
    -   This script will connect to the SQLite database.
    -   It will accept a `username` and `password` as arguments.
    -   It will hash the password using `bcrypt` (just like the main app).
    -   It will insert the new user into the `users` table.

2.  **Usage Instructions**:
    -   I will provide the commands to upload and run this script on your VPS.

### **Why this approach?**
You cannot just insert a plain text password into the database because the login system expects it to be hashed. This script handles that security requirement correctly.
