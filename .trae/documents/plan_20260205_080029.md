If the status is stuck on "initializing", it means the Puppeteer browser process is failing to start or crashing immediately on the VPS, but the error isn't bubbling up to the UI.

### **Plan**

1.  **Add Robust Logging**:
    -   Update `sessionManager.js` to log Puppeteer launch errors specifically.
    -   Currently, if `new Client()` fails inside the library, it might just hang. I'll wrap the initialization in a `try-catch` block where possible or listen for more events.

2.  **Force Chromium Path**:
    -   Sometimes the bundled Chromium doesn't work well on Linux.
    -   I will update `sessionManager.js` to check if `/usr/bin/google-chrome` or `/usr/bin/chromium-browser` exists and use it if found.
    -   This is a common fix for "headless mode" issues on Ubuntu.

3.  **Increase Timeouts**:
    -   VPS CPUs can be slow. I'll increase the `authTimeoutMs` and `qrTimeoutMs` in the client config.

4.  **Instruction**:
    -   After I update the code, you will need to upload the `server` files again and restart `pm2`.
